    "text": "I spent much of today reading the papers that Dr. Deyle provided related to EDM and quantitative fisheries. The EDM papers included applications of the approach to specific case studies, as well as the mathematical background. For example, (Sugihara et al. 2012) is the foundational paper describing the use of EDM to detect causality through convergent cross-mapping (CCM).\nI also familiarized myself with recent modeling studies related to the Atlantic sea scallop fishery. The economic value of the scallop fishery and the availability of high-quality time series data make scallops a good choice for meaningful applied data science. There have been various models created to estimate biomass (stock assessments), estimate natural mortality, and to develop an Integrated Assessment Model to inform fishery management under changing oceanographic conditions. However, these models depend on assumptions (especially about stock-recruitment relationships) that may not be justified. EDM could potentially provide new insights into the factors that impact scallop abundance without needing to make such assumption.\nThere are also many interesting spatial dynamics to consider, particularly related to the rotational management plans implemented by the New England Fishery Management Council. Another potential area of investigation relates to new research by Pousse et al., (2023) indicating that ocean acidification depresses the growth of juvenile Atlantic sea scallops. This research highlights the need for accurate forecasting of scallop populations under projected acidification conditions in order to ensure the continued prosperity of the fishery.\n\n\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, I had to spend several hours today wrangling with Git and GitHub in order to create the new repository for this notebook and successfully connect it to GitHub. The main issues were related to inconsistent authentication protocols (HTTPS vs. ssh) between my GitHub account, GitHub CLI, and local repo. Eventually, I resolved the issues and successfully link the local and remote directories and deploy this notebook as a GitHub pages site associated with the repository.\n\n\n\nIt has been several years since I last worked in Markdown, and I reviewed the basic syntax: headers, italics, bullet points, inserting links, etc. My previous experience using Markdown syntax was in R Markdown, but for this lab notebook I decided to learn Quarto. Quarto is an “open-source scientific and technical publishing system” that is used by academics to create static and dynamic documents, personal websites, CVs, books, and other media.

I plan to re-read some of the key spatial EDM papers to review the theory and the methods they used, as during my initial read I mostly focused on the introduction, results, and discussion/conclusions.

I have had many similar ethics trainings before and am always cognizant of the need to avoid scientific misconduct, but it was interesting to hear the speaker describe several high-profile misconduct cases with which I was unfamiliar (like Mark Spector)."

    "text": "I identified many recent papers that have specifically applied EDM to fisheries, several of which include comprehensive and well-annotated R scripts. I also explored the literature related to Atlantic sea scallops to see which questions have already been thoroughly examined and where I could potentially use EDM (or spatial EDM, sEDM) to fill in gaps in our scientific knowledge or confirm or refute the findings of alternative modeling approaches.\nRegardless of which of these topics I focus on, my first step will be to wrangle the dredge survey data to produce scallop time series that can be easily grouped by size, age class, and location. Getting the scallop data into a workable format will allow for an initial exploration of stock-recruitment dynamics, which could potentially be the entire focus of my project. Understanding scallop recruitment and yield-per-recruit, especially within the spatial context of a rotationally-managed fishery— is a fundamental part of accurate modeling and remains an important area of research (D. Hart 2003; Stokesbury 2012; Bethoney, Asci, and Stokesbury 2016).\n\n\nI was first interested in the use of EDM to explore the impact of predation on Atlantic sea scallops, in a similar manner to how Liu and Gaines (2022) analyzed the interactions between kelp and sea urchins in a Southern California kelp forest. I find predator-prey relationships and interspecies interactions in general to be a fascinating area of ecology. Research on the effects of sea star and crab predation on scallop recruitment in the Mid-Atlantic Bight revealed significant complexity in ecosystem, as unknown environmental variables and significant spatial and temporal variability made it difficult to identify causative relationships (D. R. Hart 2006; Shank, Hart, and Friedland 2012). EDM could potentially be very useful in more conclusively determining causality in this system. However, the time series data for scallop predators appears relatively limited (much shorter than the overall dredge survey), potentially limiting the use of EDM. I will continue to look for predator data that could facilitate an EDM analysis of this interesting system.\n\n“Nonetheless, due to the lack of quantitative analyses, the causal connection between predation pressure and sea scallop size structure interannual variability remains unknown” (Zang et al. 2023)\n\n\n\n\nEstimating natural mortality (M) is an issue of ongoing concern in fisheries management worldwide (e.g., Hamel et al. 2023; Kenchington 2014). D. R. Hart and Chang (2022) recently improved the performance of size-based scallop stock assessment models by estimating temporally variable natural mortality, rather than the historical approach of using a fixed value of M (e.g., M=0.16 for closed areas of Georges Bank). However, the likely density-dependence, spatial and temporal variability, and potential confounding of natural mortality with fishing mortality present challenges when attempting to use traditional modeling approaches to uncover the dynamics of the system (D. R. Hart and Chang 2022). Additionally, the stock assessment framework underlying previous examinations of scallop natural mortality may be obscuring the true nonlinear dynamics of the system, as stock assessment models often overestimate stability and underestimate predictability, with potentially significant implications for fisheries management (Storch et al. 2017).\n\n\n\nThe other route that I am exploring would be something related to creating an sEDM analog to the model(s) used by Zang et al. (2023), Cooley et al. (2015), or Rheuban et al. (2018). Input data would likely be size data from the dredge surveys, temperature and ocean carbonate chemistry (could use FVCOM), and food availability (primary production/phytoplankton). These models have been extremely valuable to understand how rising temperatures, ocean acidification, and fishing pressure impact scallop populations, bringing us closer to true ecosystem-based management for one of North America’s most economically valuable fisheries. However, they rely on population dynamic models based on the von Bertalanffy growth function and growth matrices, with specific growth, weight, and mortality parameters. As our knowledge of scallop physiology and life history continues to expand, it is becoming more clear that the processes relevant to the creation of these models can be highly state-dependent, so using sEDM instead of a model relying on fixed parameters could potentially yield improved forecasts of scallop abundance. For example, the first experiment on scallop response to increased CO2 and temperature showed that the independent effects of CO2 and temperature change once a CO2 threshold is reached (Pousse et al. 2023). No studies have yet utilized this insight when predicting the impacts of climate change and ocean acidification on the scallop fishery; a project using EDM to explore these impacts would therefore be the first not to rely on a model that is inconsistent with recently-uncovered mechanistic relationships. However, creating and testing such a model would be a highly involved process and may not be feasible within the remainder of the summer."

Having a concrete outline will be useful for me personally to provide direction and structure for moving forward with the project, but it will also be valuable to have a document that can be shared with others who could provide meaningful input. I conducted a fairly comprehensive literature review for the Relevance & Background and Summary of Selected Literature sections, and added many of those papers to the EDM and Scallop links pages on this website. I also started Section 3.2 in Fisheries Ecosystem Dynamics, “Compensation in simple population models”, which included subsections on continuous-time models (3.2.1) and multiple equilibria (3.2.2)."

I also updated and reformatted several pages on my lab notebook so it can be useful as a resource/literature repository in addition to documenting my progress. In the afternoon, I attended the monthly Zoom working session for the American Fisheries Society Climate Ambassador Program, a 2-year science communication program for fisheries scientists. Each month, we have a training session covering a different topic (e.g., May’s topic was dealing with challenging audiences), with a working session the following week to practice implementing what we’ve learned. The program has definitely made me more skilled at creating effective posters and presentations about my research, as I will need to do for the BRITE REU symposium in August. After the training session, I started working through some of the R code provided as supplementary material to EDM papers, with the goal of building skill and confidence working with the rEDM and multispatialCCM packages. I also read subsection 3.3.3 in Fisheries Ecosystem Dynamics, which focused on discrete-time density-dependent models and included a sub-subsection titled “Complex Dynamics” that was highly relevant to EDM."

I was already relatively comfortable working in R (certainly compared to working in Python), but it was still valuable to see alternative ways to accomplish a given task. The workshop also introduced me to Bioconductor packages, which are used for “statistical analysis and comprehension of high-throughput genomic data”.\n2. Worked through the rEDM vignette. I tried to reproduce all of the R code in the vignette and as I did so, I wrote up a list of questions to ask Dr. Deyle. In particular, I would like to know more about how to specify function inputs like the sizes of the training and prediction libraries for Simplex, S-map, and CCM; the method used to produce surrogate data for testing statistical significance, and different approaches to normalizing data before analysis.\n3. Tried to debug code. After finishing the rEDM vignette, I tried to reproduce the code provided as supplementary material to the paper “Ecosystem-based forecasts of recruitment in two menhaden species”(Deyle et al., 2018). Unlike the vignette, many of the functions produced errors when called, so I tried to identify the cause of the error and potential alternative solutions. However, the error messages were somewhat hard to interpret because the error tracebacks often referred to the underlying C++ code. For example, RStudio would produce an error message that an integer had been provided where a string was expected, but to some function called by the rEDM package, not to a function that was in my R script that I could edit."

I was comparatively more successful at debugging Chang et al., and I managed to figure out alternative ways to create the figures in the paper.\n2. Read papers applying EDM to fisheries. I especially focused on the methods sections, and took notes on steps in their analysis that would be useful perform on the scallop data (see Intro to EDM page). For example, I identified many different ways that authors have chosen to assess the statistical significance of EDM results.\n3. Tested out NOAA R packages in the SCC. I installed and explored three different packages to see if they would be useful for my project: NEFSC-Spatial (has shellfish strata), stocksmart, and ecodata. As the packages come with fairly large data files, I leveraged the power of the SCC when testing their functionality. My conclusion is that the data included in the packages has relatively coarse resolution and will likely not be directly useful for my EDM scallop project, but that they are excellent for data visualization. The plots I can produce with the NOAA packages might be good for providing context about the geographical, biological, and economic context of my project.\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\nlibrary(ecodata)\ncomdat #aggregated commercial fishing data (landings, value, etc.)\nstr(comdat)\nlevels(comdat$EPU)\n\nvarFactors &lt;- as.factor(comdat$Var)\nlevels(varFactors)\n\nlibrary(stocksmart)\nhab&lt;- habitat_occupancy\nget_available_ts(itis = 79718, jurisdiction = \"NEFMC\") #ITIS = 79718 refers to the Integrated Taxonomic Information System number for the sea scallop.\nplot_ts(itis = 79718, facetplot = T) #plots time series\nget_latest_full_assessment(itis = 79718)\nscal&lt;-get_latest_metrics(itis = 79718)\n\nscallopData&lt;- stockAssessmentData %&gt;% \n  filter(ITIS==79718)"

    "text": "A dynamical system is a system whose state is uniquely specified by a set of variables (state variables) and whose behavior is described by predefined rules (Sayama 2015). The dynamical system evolves over time in the state space, which is the set of all possible values of the state variables. If a state space is continuous (i.e., the state variables are not restricted to discrete values) and finite-dimensional, the number of state variables defines the dimension of the dynamical system.\nIf a dynamical system is deterministic, future states of the system can be predicted from the past behavior of the system, even if the trajectories appear chaotic (Sugihara and May 1990). In a nonlinear system, interactions between variables are state-dependent: for example, the correlation between fish and zooplankton populations in the Baltic Sea changes sign depending on planktivore abundance, with two different ecosystem configurations (top-down vs. bottom-up forcing) on either side of a planktivore threshold (Casini et al. 2009).\n\nEmpirical dynamic modeling (EDM) uses time series data to analyze and forecast nonlinear systems, which are extremely common in the natural world (E. R. Deyle, May, et al. 2016). Ecologists classically model species interactions using a community matrix, a matrix of the partial derivatives (the Jacobian) of the system evaluated at equilibrium. The sign and magnitude of the coefficients in the matrix represent the direction and intensity, respectively, of the impact of a change in population of one species on the population of another. However, as with the Baltic Sea fish example, having a single matrix of coefficients does not suffice to describe a complex nonlinear system because the interaction between species can vary with the state of the ecosystem (E. R. Deyle, May, et al. 2016). Methods based on linear regression to analyze nonlinear ecological systems, while extremely valuable, have many weaknesses, including the inability to distinguish interactions between species from the effect of a shared driving variable like temperature (see the Moran Effect).\n\nIn EDM, the state of a dynamical system is a specific location in a multivariate coordinate space, or state space, whose coordinate axes are causally coupled ecosystem variables such as species abundance, temperature, resources, etc. The state of the system changes in time according to the rules/equations that describe the system dynamics, and this in turn traces out a trajectory. The collection of these time-series trajectories forms a geometric object called an attractor manifold, which describes empirically how variables relate to each other in time. (E. R. Deyle, May, et al. 2016)\n\nMotion on the attractor manifold can be projected onto a coordinate axis, forming a time series. On the other hand, we can use time series data to reconstruct the dynamics of the system in multidimensional state space, called attractor reconstruction (Chang, Ushio, and Hsieh 2017). In the real world, we often lack the necessary data (e.g., time series for cod, phytoplankton, and zooplankton) to reconstruct the dynamics of a system, and we likely do not even know all of the variables that dictate the state of the system. Using Takens’ theorem, we can use time-delay embedding to reconstruct a “shadow manifold” that preserves the essential dynamics of the original system.\nIntroduction to Empirical Dynamic Modeling (YouTube video)\nConstructing Empirical Dynamic Models: Takens’Theorem (YouTube video)\n\n\nSimplex projection is a non-parametric analysis in state space used to determine the optimal embedding dimension, \\(E\\), of a system. This is important for future EDM techniques and can offer insight into the dimensionality (and complexity) of a given system. Papers that provide helpful and more technically rigorous descriptions of simplex projection include Ye, Beamish, et al. (2015), Chang, Ushio, and Hsieh (2017), Sugihara and May (1990), and the vignette for the R package rEDM, which also describes how to perform the analysis in R. Roughly, simplex projection is done as follows:\n\nChoose an embedding dimension, \\(E\\)\nUse the \\(E+1\\) nearest neighbors of the target point in \\(E\\)-dimensional space to enclose the predictee in a minimal polygon (simplex)\nUse the future position of the simplex to predict the future position of the predictee\n\nTake the weighted average of the forward evolutions of the neighboring points (the average scaled by Euclidean distance of the nearest neighbor to the predictee)\n\nEvaluate the predictive skill of the simplex projection, such as by computing the correlation coefficient \\(\\rho\\) between the forecasted and observed results.\nRepeat the process with different values of \\(E\\) to determine which \\(E\\) results in the highest predictive skill, indicating the optimal embedding dimension\n\n**NOTES **\n\n\\(E\\) is not necessarily the same as the true dimension of the system, \\(D\\), or the number of variables being analyzed (e.g., number of species in a trophic web), but it is bounded such that \\(E&lt;2D+1\\)\nIt is sometimes helpful to take the first differences in a target variable to distinguish meaningful prediction ability arising from the system dynamics from the statistical prediction resulting from autocorrelation. For example, E. Deyle et al. (2018) used \\(ΔLPUE(t) = LPUE(t + 1) − LPUE(t)\\) rather than simply \\(LPUE(t)\\).\n\n\n\n\nS-map analysis can be used to distinguish nonlinear dynamical systems from linear stochastic systems and identify the degree of state-dependency of a system (Sugihara 1994).S-mapping is a forecasting method that uses locally weighted multivariate linear regressions calculated as the system moves along its attractor. Rather than using only nearby points, S-maps uses the entire library of points on the attractor, where points are given an exponentially decaying weight based on their distance from the target point.\nHelpful explanations of how S-mapping works can be found in the Methods sections of (Glaser et al. 2011),(E. R. Deyle, May, et al. 2016) and (E. Deyle et al. 2018), as well as in (Chang, Ushio, and Hsieh 2017).\n\nS-map analysis is a locally weighted linear regression performed under the state space associated with a weighting function in the form of an exponential decay kernel, \\(w(d) = e^{(−θ d/\\bar{d})}\\). Here, \\(d\\) is the distance between the predictee and each library point, and \\(\\bar{d}\\) is the mean distance of all paired library points. The parameter θ controls the degree of state dependency. If θ = 0, all library points have the same weight regardless of the local state of the predictee; mathematically, this model reduces to a linear autoregressive model. In contrast, if θ &gt; 0, the forecast given by the S-map depends on the local state of the predictee, and thus produces locally different fittings. Therefore, by comparing the performance of equivalent linear (θ = 0) and nonlinear (θ &gt; 0) S-map models, one can distinguish nonlinear dynamical systems from linear stochastic systems. (Chang, Ushio, and Hsieh 2017)\n\nWe can quantify the state-dependency of the system by finding the improvement in prediction skill of the nonlinear model compared to a linear model, \\(Δ\\rho=\\rho_\\theta-\\rho_{(\\theta=0)}\\). The statistical significance of S-map results can be analyzed by generating a randomized version of the time series that maintains the fundamental statistical properties of the real data set (like autocorrelation), but is otherwise completely random. Performing S-map analysis on a large sample of such randomly-generated series will generate a null distribution of the S-map predictability \\(\\rho\\) and \\(Δ\\rho\\). Thus, we can find the probability of obtaining the \\(\\rho\\) and \\(Δ\\rho\\) values from the real data if the underlying nonlinear dynamics were not present.\n\n\n\nState Space Reconstruction: Convergent Cross Mapping (YouTube video)\nCCM can detect causal linkages between time series and distinguish such causality from correlation arising from a shared environmental driver. (Sugihara et al. 2012) provides a comprehensive description of how CCM works, with general explanations also available in (Chang, Ushio, and Hsieh 2017), (Ye, Deyle, et al. 2015),(E. R. Deyle et al. 2013), and (E. Deyle et al. 2018), among others.\nIn essence, CCM measures the extent to which the historical record of \\(Y\\)’s values (the shadow manifold \\(M_Y\\) built from \\(Y\\) and the appropriate number of time lags) can be used to predict states of \\(X\\). If \\(X\\) causes \\(Y\\), information about the state of \\(X\\) can be recovered from \\(M_Y\\) and having a more detailed \\(M_Y\\) (bigger library size = a denser manifold) increases the prediction skill of \\(X\\). Therefore, significant convergence when using \\(M_Y\\) to predict \\(X\\) (i.e., \\(Y\\) crossmap \\(X\\)) indicates causality in the reverse direction, \\(X\\Rightarrow Y\\). For a stochastic forcing variable \\(X\\), the current state of \\(Y\\) cannot be inferred from values of \\(X\\), so a manifold reconstructed from lags of \\(X\\) will not reliably estimate \\(Y\\); i.e., \\(X\\) crossmap \\(Y\\) will fail to converge.\nHere is a collection of papers that I have read that used (non-spatial) CCM to identify causality in complex ecosystems:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthor, year\nTitle\nNotes\n\n\n\n\nSugihara et al.

    "text": "Welcome! Here I will document my work as an intern in the Deyle Lab as part of the 2023 BRITE REU program at Boston University. This lab notebook will provide evidence of my daily work on the project and will ensure that my methods are understandable and reproducible. I strongly believe in the importance of open, transparent, and accessible data science, and I hope that I can help support efforts to promote these principles within fisheries science and quantitative marine ecology."
