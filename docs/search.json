    "text": "BRITE REU trainings & workshops\nThis morning we had our first programming workshop as part of the BRITE REU program, led by Michael Silverstein. We learned how to access the SSC and set up interactive sessions in Jupyter Notebook and RStudio.\nWe then had an ethics training alongside students from other REU programs at Boston University. I have had many similar ethics trainings before and am always cognizant of the need to avoid scientific misconduct, but it was interesting to hear the speaker describe several high-profile misconduct cases with which I was unfamiliar (like Mark Spector).\n\n\nEDM\nI spent this afternoon reading and re-reading papers that Dr. Deyle provided related to EDM. I also read more about the basics of dynamical systems theory, which underpins EDM (and indeed, much of modern science). I started working on an Intro to EDM page for this site and found that attempting to articulate the concepts in my own words was tremendously helpful in solidifying my understanding of the concepts."

    "text": "I spent much of today reading the papers that Dr. Deyle provided related to EDM and quantitative fisheries. The EDM papers included applications of the approach to specific case studies, as well as the mathematical background. For example, (Sugihara et al. 2012) is the foundational paper describing the use of EDM to detect causality through convergent cross-mapping (CCM).\nI also familiarized myself with recent modeling studies related to the Atlantic sea scallop fishery. The economic value of the scallop fishery and the availability of high-quality time series data make scallops a good choice for meaningful applied data science. There have been various models created to estimate biomass (stock assessments), estimate natural mortality, and to develop an Integrated Assessment Model to inform fishery management under changing oceanographic conditions. However, these models depend on assumptions (especially about stock-recruitment relationships) that may not be justified. EDM could potentially provide new insights into the factors that impact scallop abundance without needing to make such assumption.\nThere are also many interesting spatial dynamics to consider, particularly related to the rotational management plans implemented by the New England Fishery Management Council. Another potential area of investigation relates to new research by Pousse et al., (2023) indicating that ocean acidification depresses the growth of juvenile Atlantic sea scallops. This research highlights the need for accurate forecasting of scallop populations under projected acidification conditions in order to ensure the continued prosperity of the fishery."

    "text": "A dynamical system is a system whose state is uniquely specified by a set of variables (state variables) and whose behavior is described by predefined rules (Sayama 2015). The dynamical system evolves over time in the state space, which is the set of all possible values of the state variables. If a state space is continuous (i.e., the state variables are not restricted to discrete values) and finite-dimensional, the number of state variables defines the dimension of the dynamical system.\nIf a dynamical system is deterministic, future states of the system can be predicted from the past behavior of the system, even if the trajectories appear chaotic (Sugihara and May 1990). In a nonlinear system, interactions between variables are state-dependent: for example, the correlation between fish and zooplankton populations in the Baltic Sea changes sign depending on planktivore abundance, with two different ecosystem configurations (top-down vs. bottom-up forcing) on either side of a planktivore threshold (Casini et al. 2009).\n\nEmpirical dynamic modeling (EDM) uses time series data to analyze and forecast nonlinear systems, which are extremely common in the natural world (E. R. Deyle et al. 2016). Ecologists classically model species interactions using a community matrix, a matrix of the partial derivatives (the Jacobian) of the system evaluated at equilibrium. The sign and magnitude of the coefficients in the matrix represent the direction and intensity, respectively, of the impact of a change in population of one species on the population of another. However, as with the Baltic Sea fish example, having a single matrix of coefficients does not suffice to describe a complex nonlinear system because the interaction between species can vary with the state of the ecosystem (E. R. Deyle et al. 2016). Methods based on linear regression to analyze nonlinear ecological systems, while extremely valuable, have many weaknesses, including the inability to distinguish interactions between species from the effect of a shared driving variable like temperature (see the Moran Effect).\n\nIn EDM, the state of a dynamical system is a specific location in a multivariate coordinate space, or state space, whose coordinate axes are causally coupled ecosystem variables such as species abundance, temperature, resources, etc. The state of the system changes in time according to the rules/equations that describe the system dynamics, and this in turn traces out a trajectory. The collection of these time-series trajectories forms a geometric object called an attractor manifold, which describes empirically how variables relate to each other in time. (E. R. Deyle et al. 2016)\n\nMotion on the attractor manifold can be projected onto a coordinate axis, forming a time series. On the other hand, we can use time series data to reconstruct the dynamics of the system in multidimensional state space, called attractor reconstruction (Chang, Ushio, and Hsieh 2017). In the real world, we often lack the necessary data (e.g., time series for cod, phytoplankton, and zooplankton) to reconstruct the dynamics of a system, and we likely do not even know all of the variables that dictate the state of the system. Using Takens’ theorem, we can use time-delay embedding to reconstruct a “shadow manifold” that preserves the essential dynamics of the original system.\nIntroduction to Empirical Dynamic Modeling (YouTube video) Constructing Empirical Dynamic Models: Takens’Theorem (YouTube video)\n\n\nSimplex projection is a non-parametric analysis in state space used to determine the optimal embedding dimension, \\(E\\), of a system. This is important for future EDM techniques and can offer insight into the dimensionality (and complexity) of a given system. Papers that provide helpful and more technically rigorous descriptions of simplex projection include Ye et al. (2015), Chang, Ushio, and Hsieh (2017), Sugihara and May (1990), and the vignette for the R package rEDM, which also describes how to perform the analysis in R. Roughly, simplex projection is done as follows:\n\nChoose an embedding dimension, \\(E\\)\nUse the \\(E+1\\) nearest neighbors of the target point in \\(E\\)-dimensional space to enclose the predictee in a minimal polygon (simplex)\nUse the future position of the simplex to predict the future position of the predictee\n\nTake the weighted average of the forward evolutions of the neighboring points (the average scaled by Euclidean distance of the nearest neighbor to the predictee)\n\nEvaluate the predictive skill of the simplex projection, such as by computing the correlation coefficient \\(\\rho\\) between the forecasted and observed results.\nRepeat the process with different values of \\(E\\) to determine which \\(E\\) results in the highest predictive skill, indicating the optimal embedding dimension\n\n** \\(E\\) is not necessarily the same as the true dimension of the system, \\(D\\), or the number of variables being analyzed (e.g., number of species in a trophic web), but it is bounded such that \\(E<2D+1\\) **\n\n\n\nS-map analysis can be used to distinguish nonlinear dynamical systems from linear stochastic systems and identify the degree of state-dependency of a system (Sugihara 1994).S-mapping is a forecasting method that uses locally weighted multivariate linear regressions calculated as the system moves along its attractor. Rather than using only nearby points, S-maps uses the entire library of points on the attractor, where points are given an exponentially decaying weight based on their distance from the target point.\nHelpful explanations of how S-mapping works can be found in the Methods sections of (E. R. Deyle et al. 2016) and (E. Deyle et al. 2018), as well as in (Chang, Ushio, and Hsieh 2017).\n\nS-map analysis is a locally weighted linear regression performed under the state space associated with a weighting function in the form of an exponential decay kernel, \\(w(d) = e^{(−θ d/\\bar{d})}\\). Here, \\(d\\) is the distance between the predictee and each library point, and \\(\\bar{d}\\) is the mean distance of all paired library points. The parameter θ controls the degree of state dependency. If θ = 0, all library points have the same weight regardless of the local state of the predictee; mathematically, this model reduces to linear autoregressive model. In contrast, if θ > 0, the forecast given by the S-map depends on the local state of the predictee, and thus produces locally different fittings. Therefore, by comparing the performance of equivalent linear (θ = 0) and nonlinear (θ > 0) S-map models, one can distinguish nonlinear dynamical systems from linear stochastic systems. (Chang, Ushio, and Hsieh 2017)\n\n\n\n\nState Space Reconstruction: Convergent Cross Mapping (YouTube video)\nConvergent cross-mapping is…\nHere is a collection of papers that have used CCM to identify causality in complex ecosystems:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthor, year\nTitle\nNotes\n\n\n\n\nSugihara et al.
