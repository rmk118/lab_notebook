    "text": "I spent much of today reading the papers that Dr. Deyle provided related to EDM and quantitative fisheries. The EDM papers included applications of the approach to specific case studies, as well as the mathematical background. For example, (Sugihara et al. 2012) is the foundational paper describing the use of EDM to detect causality through convergent cross-mapping (CCM).\nI also familiarized myself with recent modeling studies related to the Atlantic sea scallop fishery. The economic value of the scallop fishery and the availability of high-quality time series data make scallops a good choice for meaningful applied data science. There have been various models created to estimate biomass (stock assessments), estimate natural mortality, and to develop an Integrated Assessment Model to inform fishery management under changing oceanographic conditions. However, these models depend on assumptions (especially about stock-recruitment relationships) that may not be justified. EDM could potentially provide new insights into the factors that impact scallop abundance without needing to make such assumption.\nThere are also many interesting spatial dynamics to consider, particularly related to the rotational management plans implemented by the New England Fishery Management Council. Another potential area of investigation relates to new research by Pousse et al., (2023) indicating that ocean acidification depresses the growth of juvenile Atlantic sea scallops. This research highlights the need for accurate forecasting of scallop populations under projected acidification conditions in order to ensure the continued prosperity of the fishery."

The main issues were related to inconsistent authentication protocols (HTTPS vs. ssh) between my GitHub account, GitHub CLI, and local repo. Eventually, I resolved the issues and successfully link the local and remote directories and deploy this notebook as a GitHub pages site associated with the repository."

Quarto is an “open-source scientific and technical publishing system” that is used by academics to create static and dynamic documents, personal websites, CVs, books, and other media. Called the next generation of R Markdown, knowing how to use Quarto will be a valuable skill for this REU project as well as future research endeavors."

I found the entire symposium very interesting and filled up five pages of my notebook with concepts, techniques, and papers mentioned in the presentations that I wanted to save to look up on my own later. Here are some examples of things I recorded that were novel to me or that particularly caught my interest:\n\nThe phyllosphere\nFlux Balance Analysis\nMacArthur’s consumer-resource model\nGenomic epidemiology\n\nMy favorite part of the symposium was Dr. Alan Pacheco’s presentation on “Mapping Interaction Networks in Plant Microbiomes”, although I also enjoyed PhD candidate Helen Scott’s lightning talk on “Charting Carbon Use Efficiency in Ocean Microbiomes”.\nCool papers mentioned or cited at the conference include:\n\nMicrobiology of the phyllosphere (Lindow and Brandl, 2003)\nMapping phyllosphere microbiota interactions in planta to establish genotype-phenotype relationships (Schäfer et al., 2022)\nA protocol for generating a high-quality genome-scale metabolic reconstruction (Thiele and Palsson, 2010)\nWhat is flux balance analysis?
