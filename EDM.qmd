description: 'An overview of Empirical Dynamic Modeling (EDM) as I understand it. The goal is to perform somewhat of a literature review and solidify my understanding of EDM and its applications by describing the concepts in my own words, or at least compile language from the various sources that have been most helpful in building my intuition around EDM.'

# Dynamical systems
A dynamical system is a system whose state is uniquely specified by a set of variables (state variables) and whose behavior is described by predefined rules. The dynamical system evolves over time in the state space, which is the set of all possible values of the state variables. If a state space is continuous (i.e., the state variables are not restricted to discrete values) and finite-dimensional, the number of state variables defines the dimension of the dynamical system.

In a discrete dynamical system, we can represent the change in a state variable $x$ over time as a difference equation, also called a recurrence equation: $x_t = F(x_{t-1}, t)$

For a deterministic dynamical system, the change in the state variable is represented as a differential equation:


We can represent states as vectors corresponding to locations on 

# Basic idea
Ecological interactions in natural systems are often (nonlinear, or state-dependent), meaning the 
mpirical Dynamic Modeling (EDM) is...



# Spatial EDM
Spatial data can be incorporated into EDM in a variety of ways.
