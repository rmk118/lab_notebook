# BRITE REU trainings & workshops
This morning we had our first programming workshop as part of the BRITE REU program, led by Michael Silverstein. We learned how to access the SSC and set up interactive sessions in Jupyter Notebook and RStudio.

We then had an ethics training.


# Reading papers
I spent this afternoon reading and re-reading papers that Dr. Deyle provided related to EDM and quantitative fisheries.
