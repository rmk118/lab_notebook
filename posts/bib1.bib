	abstract = {Marine protected areas ({MPAs}) may create challenges for stock assessments because most models are based on the assumption that fishing mortality is uniform in space. Using both actual data and simulations, we explored two approaches to the stock assessment of Georges Bank Atlantic sea scallops (Placopecten magellanicus), where fishery closures were implemented in December 1994. One approach modeled the stock in “aggregate”, using domed commercial selectivity functions for the time periods when the {MPAs} were closed to scallop fishing. In the second “split” approach, separate models were used for the scallops inside (closed areas) and outside (open areas) the {MPAs}. The aggregate model converged only in 17\% of the simulated runs, compared with 93\% convergence for the open and closed runs using the split approach. With actual data, and in those simulations where both methods converged, the two approaches gave similar results, although biomass estimates in the most recent years from the aggregate model tended to be biased low. The closed area model, and to a lesser extent the aggregate model, estimated natural mortality M fairly precisely, but open area model estimates of M were poorly defined. Retrospective patterns were reduced using the split approach and when natural mortality was estimated. We conclude that the split assessment approach is better for sea scallops, but it may be best to use both approaches for comparative purposes.},

	abstract = {We estimate temporally varying natural mortality within a size-based stock assessment model for U.S. sea scallops in three different regions, and compare the results to corresponding models where natural mortality is not estimated, and (in one case) where only the mean natural mortality is estimated. In one model, for the Georges Bank Closed Areas, natural mortality was estimated by year for all sizes, whereas in the other two models (for the Georges Bank Open Areas and the Mid-Atlantic Bight), annual variation in natural mortality was estimated for juveniles only. Estimating natural mortality by year improved the performance over fixed natural mortality in all three models, as measured by Akaike’s information criterion ({AIC}) and reduced retrospective patterns. There was evidence that natural mortality is density-dependent. Large recruitment events were associated with substantial increases in juvenile natural mortality, and natural mortality in the Georges Bank Closed Areas tended to increase at high biomass. Estimation of natural mortality was facilitated by survey data that gave estimates of absolute abundance together with low fishing mortality that minimized the confounding between natural and fishing mortality. Natural mortality is an important process that should be estimated when there is sufficient information to do so.},

	abstract = {Ocean acidification, the progressive change in ocean chemistry caused by uptake of atmospheric {CO}2, is likely to affect some marine resources negatively, including shellfish. The Atlantic sea scallop (Placopecten magellanicus) supports one of the most economically important single-species commercial fisheries in the United States. Careful management appears to be the most powerful short-term factor affecting scallop populations, but in the coming decades scallops will be increasingly influenced by global environmental changes such as ocean warming and ocean acidification. In this paper, we describe an integrated assessment model ({IAM}) that numerically simulates oceanographic, population dynamic, and socioeconomic relationships for the U.S. commercial sea scallop fishery. Our primary goal is to enrich resource management deliberations by offering both short- and long-term insight into the system and generating detailed policy-relevant information about the relative effects of ocean acidification, temperature rise, fishing pressure, and socioeconomic factors on the fishery using a simplified model system. Starting with relationships and data used now for sea scallop fishery management, the model adds socioeconomic decision making based on static economic theory and includes ocean biogeochemical change resulting from {CO}2 emissions. The model skillfully reproduces scallop population dynamics, market dynamics, and seawater carbonate chemistry since 2000. It indicates sea scallop harvests could decline substantially by 2050 under {RCP} 8.5 {CO}2 emissions and current harvest rules, assuming that ocean acidification affects P. magellanicus by decreasing recruitment and slowing growth, and that ocean warming increases growth. Future work will explore different economic and management scenarios and test how potential impacts of ocean acidification on other scallop biological parameters may influence the social-ecological system. Future empirical work on the effect of ocean acidification on sea scallops is also needed.},

	abstract = {Recent developments in complex systems analysis have led to new techniques for detecting causal relationships using relatively short time series, on the order of 30 sequential observations. Although many ecological observation series are even shorter, perhaps fewer than ten sequential observations, these shorter time series are often highly replicated in space (i.e., plot replication). Here, we combine the existing techniques of convergent cross mapping ({CCM}) and dewdrop regression to build a novel test of causal relations that leverages spatial replication, which we call multispatial {CCM}. Using examples from simulated and real-world ecological data, we test the ability of multispatial {CCM} to detect causal relationships between processes. We find that multispatial {CCM} successfully detects causal relationships with as few as five sequential observations, even in the presence of process noise and observation error. Our results suggest that this technique may constitute a useful test for causality in systems where experiments are difficult to perform and long time series are not available. This new technique is available in the {multispatialCCM} package for the R programming language.},

	abstract = {There has been a recent demand for forecasting in ecology, particularly in the field of ecosystem management. Empirical dynamic modelling ({EDM}), an equation-free nonlinear forecasting method, is receiving growing attention, but it requires long time series to produce accurate predictions. Though most ecological time series are short, spatial replicates are often available. Here we explore how utilizing available spatial data can improve our ability to forecast ecological dynamics. There are several ways to incorporate spatial information into {EDM} and not all have been applied in ecology. We compare spatial {EDM} approaches used in ecology and physics and introduce a flexible Bayesian model that makes use of prior movement information. We test these methods on simulated data generated with three population dynamics models with varying levels of complexity, time series length, spatial symmetry and heterogeneity. Adding spatial data generally improves accuracy, though the best method depends on the spatial process. We applied the methods to empirical fisheries data, highlighting the complexity of real population dynamics. Leveraging spatial data is an effective way to overcome the problem of short ecological time series. Since the best forecasting method depends on the underlying dynamics, we suggest that users apply several in concert and that this may be useful in identifying spatial heterogeneity in dynamics.},

The incorporation of spatial structure into fishery stock assessment models should ultimately improve forecasts of stock biomass. Here, we describe a nonlinear time series model for producing spatially explicit forecasts of {CPUE} that does not require ancillary environmental or demographic data, or specification of a model functional form. We demonstrate this method using spatially resolved (1° × 1° cells) {CPUE} time series of North Pacific albacore in the California Current System. The spatial model is highly significant (P {\textless} 0.00001) and outperforms two spatial null models. We then create a spatial forecast map for years beyond the range of data. Such approaches can guide spatial management of resources and provide a complement to more data-intensive, highly parameterized population dynamics and ecosystem models currently in use.},

	abstract = {This study assessed the energy budget for juvenile Atlantic Sea Scallop, Placopecten magellanicus, during a natural drop in temperature (15.6°C to 5.8°C) over an 8-week time period during the fall at three different enrichment levels of carbon dioxide ({CO}2). Every 2 weeks, individuals were sampled for ecophysiological measurements of feeding activity, respiration rate ({RR}) and excretion rate ({ER}) to enable the calculation of scope for growth ({SFG}) and atomic oxygen:nitrogen ratios (O:N). In addition, 36 individuals per treatment were removed for shell height, dry tissue weight ({DTW}) and dry shell weight ({DSW}). We found a significant decrease in feeding rates as {CO}2 increased. Those rates also were significantly affected by temperature, with highest feeding at 9.4°C. No significant {CO}2 effect was observed for catabolic energy processes ({RR} and {ER}); however, these rates did increase significantly with temperature. The O:N ratio was not significantly affected by {CO}2, but was significantly affected by temperature. There was a significant interaction between {CO}2 and temperature for {ER} and the O:N ratio, with low {CO}2 levels resulting in a U-shaped response that was not sustained as {CO}2 levels increased. This suggests that the independent effects of {CO}2 and temperature observed at low levels are different once a {CO}2 threshold is reached. Additionally, there were significant differences in growth estimators (shell height and {DSW}), with the best growth occurring at the lowest {CO}2 level. In contrast to temperature variations that induced a trade-off response in energy acquisition and expenditure, results from this research support the hypothesis that sea scallops have a limited ability to alter physiological processes to compensate for increasing {CO}2.},
