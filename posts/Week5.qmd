## Monday, July 3 (+ preceding weekend)

1. I spent most of the day working with the scallop data that Dr. Hart emailed me on Friday. As she requested, I created an R script that turns the data file she gave me into two data frames with lists of 3 or more consecutive stations that have been labeled as star/crab samples not taken. I also manually read the catch comment for each station to evaluate the possibility that crabs/starfish might have been sampled at that station and the catch photo needs to be checked.
2. I worked through the SCC+Bash BRITE Workshop materials that Michael emailed us so I will be prepared for the workshop on Thursday. I learned a great deal of new syntax and practiced creating and running basic bash scripts on the SCC.
