# Papers

## EDM Papers - Theory
### Set 1
I started with [@sugihara_detecting_2012], the foundational paper describing the use of EDM to detect causality through convergent cross-mapping (CCM).


### Sets 2 & 3




## EDM Papers - Applications to Fisheries
EDM has been applied to a variety of fisheries to investigate the complex relationships between stock biomass, recruitment, and environmental variables.

## Scallops
My project will tentatively focus on the Atlantic sea scallop, *Placopecten magellanicus*.

### Why scallops?
* Economic importance: among the most valuable fisheries in the country
* Data quality: 
* Benthic-pelagic coupling

New research has revealed that ocean acidification 


# Building this notebook

## Git and GitHub
Unfortunately, I had to spend several hours today wrangling with Git and GitHub in order to create the new repository for this notebook and successfully connect it to GitHub. The main issues were related to inconsistent authentication protocols (HTTPS vs. ssh) between my GitHub account, GitHub CLI, and local repo. Eventually, I resolved the issues and successfully link the local and remote directories and deploy this notebook as a GitHub pages site associated with the repository.

## Quarto and Markdown
It has been several years since I last worked in Markdown, and I reviewed the basic syntax: headers, italics, bullet points, inserting links, etc. My previous experience using Markdown syntax was in R Markdown, but for this lab notebook I decided to learn Quarto. [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) is an "open-source scientific and technical publishing system" that is used by academics to create static and dynamic documents, personal websites, CVs, books, and other media. Called the next generation of R Markdown, knowing how to use Quarto will be a valuable skill for this REU project as well as future research endeavors.
